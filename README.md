Step 1: Define the Scope

The first step in a security audit is to define its scope. This includes identifying the systems, locations, and procedures that will be audited. The scope should be defined based on the organization's security policy, regulatory requirements, and business needs.

➡ A comprehensive security audit will assess an organization’s security controls relating to the following: 

⚪ Physical components of your information system and the environment in which the information system is housed. 

⚪ Applications and software, including security patches your systems administrators, have already implemented.

⚪ Network vulnerabilities, including public and private access and firewall configurations. 

⚪ The human dimension, including how employees collect, share, and store highly sensitive information. 

⚪ The organization’s overall security strategy, including security policies, organization charts, and risk assessments.
