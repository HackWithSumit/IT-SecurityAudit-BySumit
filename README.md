Step 1: Define the Scope

The first step in a security audit is to define its scope. This includes identifying the systems, locations, and procedures that will be audited. The scope should be defined based on the organization's security policy, regulatory requirements, and business needs.

➡ A comprehensive security audit will assess an organization’s security controls relating to the following: 

⚪ Physical components of your information system and the environment in which the information system is housed. 

⚪ Applications and software, including security patches your systems administrators, have already implemented.

⚪ Network vulnerabilities, including public and private access and firewall configurations. 

⚪ The human dimension, including how employees collect, share, and store highly sensitive information. 

⚪ The organization’s overall security strategy, including security policies, organization charts, and risk assessments.


<h2><b></b>How Does a Security Audit Work?</h2></b></h2>


A security audit works by testing whether your organization’s information systems are adhering to a set of internal or external criteria regulating data security, network security, and infrastructure security. Internal criteria include your company’s IT policies, procedures, and security controls. External criteria include federal regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), and standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or the National Institute for Standards in Technology (NIST). Using a blend of internal and external criteria typically yields the best benefits for organizations performing these types of audits. A security audit compares your organization’s actual IT practices with the standards relevant to your enterprise and will identify areas for remediation and growth. Specifically, auditors will review security controls for adequacy, validate compliance with security policies, identify breaches, and ultimately make recommendations to address their findings.

The audit will result in a report with observations, recommended changes, and other details about your security program. The audit report may describe specific security vulnerabilities or reveal previously undiscovered security breaches. These findings can then be used to inform your cybersecurity risk management approach. Most of the time, auditors will rank their findings in order of priority — it’s up to your organization’s stakeholders to determine if those priorities align with the business’s strategies and objectives.
